            Ultimate Luxury Vehicles
        </h3>
        <p>
            Car and Driver's rankings are arrived at from the results of our 
            extensive instrumented testing of more than 400 vehicles each year 
            and from our expert editors' subjective impressions gained in real-world driving.
             We've ranked the Ultimate Luxury Vehicles based on roughly 200 data points 
             encompassing acceleration, handling, comfort, cargo space, fuel efficiency, value,
              and how enjoyable they are to drive. We take rankings seriously 
              because we want you to know everything about the vehicles that you're interested in.
